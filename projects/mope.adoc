:mope: MoPE
The missing integrated development environment for Modelica. Use your favourite
text editor for developing Modelica. {mope} integrates code completion, semantic
error highlighting, go to declaration and go to documentation into various
text editors.

== Installation
In order to install and configure {mope}, several steps are needed.
First download the
https://github.com/THM-MoTE/mope-server/releases/download/v0.6/mope-server-0.6.jar[server jar]
and install the https://atom.io/packages/mope[Atom plugin].

=== Configuration
Start the server by typing
[source]
----
  $ java -jar mope-server-0.6.jar
----

and configure the `~/.mope/mope.conf` file as follows:

* Define which compiler to use in the `compiler` key. Currently we are supporting
  OpenModelica (`om`) as well as JModelica (`jm`).
* Define the path to the compiler in the `compilerExecutable` key. If you want to
  use OpenModelica insert the path to the `omc` executable. If you want to use
  JModelica insert the path to the `IPython script` of JModelica. This script is
  usually located in the home directory of JModelica.
* Additionally you can modify the port number which is used by the service process
  with the `http.port` key.

----
http.interface = localhost
http.port = 9001

#which compiler to use?
#Currently we are supporting OpenModelica (omc) and JModelica (jm)
compiler = omc

#where is the compiler?
#Either the OpenModelica compiler-executable called "omc" or
#the "IPython script" delivered from JModelica, which should be located at:
#${JMODELICA_HOME}/IPython
compilerExecutable = "/usr/bin/omc"

Restart the service process and configure the Atom plugin in it's settings menu.
The settings menu is available through menu:Atom[Preferences > Packages > {mope}].

Make sure that the __Interface__ and __Port__ settings are matching `http.interface` and `http.port`
in the server configuration file `~/.mope/mope.conf`. Also define the full path to a
java executable in `Java Exec` and the path to the server jar in `Mope Exec`.
Finally enable `Start Server`.

Now open up a directory in Atom which contains your Modelica project and start
using {mope} by typing `Mope: Connect` into the Command Palette.
