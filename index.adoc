MoTE is a set of small tools/applications for developing Modelica.
The tools are open-source and designed in terms of the first part of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy[Unix philosophy]
which states that a program should *do one thing and do it well*.
Currently MoTE provides applications for developing Modelica (_MoPE_),
for designing the graphical representation of a Modelica model
(_MoVE_), and for creating connections between Modelica models (_MoDE_).

The long term goal of MoTE is to provide an alternative development suite for
Modelica which is _easy to use and extent_. The tools should be easy to use for
seasoned developers as well as newcomers. Futhermore they should be suitable
for _easy teaching_ Modelica at universities.
We invite everyone to participate in our projects. Every help is appreciated.
